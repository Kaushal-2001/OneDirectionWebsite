                Horan, Malik, Payne, Styles and Tomlinson signed up as solo candidates for The X Factor in 2010 .
                In the end they couldn't progress to the 'Boys' category, but still on stage they were suggested 
                to continue as a group, to which they agreed. Their coach became Simon Cowell . After four weeks,
                they were Cowell's last act to compete. One Direction finished third. After The X Factor leaked 
                their single Forever young , which would have been released if they had won. Social media, in combination
                with a sophisticated marketing strategy, subsequently created a real worldwide hype around the band
